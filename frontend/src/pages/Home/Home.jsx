            <p>
                Up to 2 million Americans use sign language daily as their primary language, but
                less than 3% of people in the US can understand ASL. This site will aid users in
                getting started with learning sign language by gamifying the basics of ASL,
                including gesture tracking to learn and practice signs, quizzes and real-world
                examples to aid learning, along with a fun leaderboard for users to compete against
                each other.
